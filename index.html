<h4><a href="https://vda.li/en/posts/2024/02/13/CentOS-Connect-report/">CentOS Connect 2024 report</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>February 1st-4th I participated in two events in Brussels: CentOS Connect and
FOSDEM. FOSDEM is getting closer to its quarter a century anniversary next
year. With 67 mini-conferences and another 30 events around it, it is
considered one of the largest conferences in Europe, any topic included. This
report is about CentOS Connect.</p>

<h2 id="centos-connect">CentOS Connect</h2>

<p><a href="https://connect.centos.org">CentOS Connect</a> was a two-day event preceding
FOSDEM. Organized by the CentOS project, it brought together contributors from
multiple projects around CentOS Stream upstreams (such as Fedora Project) and
downstreams (from Red Hat Enterprise Linux, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, and
others), long-time users and community members. A lot of talks were given on
both days and several special interest groups (SIGs) ran their workshops on the
first day.</p>

<h2 id="centos-integration-sig">CentOS Integration SIG</h2>

<p>I have attended a workshop organized by the CentOS Integration SIG. The focus
of this group is to define and run integration tests around CentOS Stream
delivery to the public. While CentOS Stream composes are built using the
messages on how RHEL next minor version is composed after being thoroughly
tested by Red Hat’s quality engineering group, there is a value in testing
CentOS Stream composes by other community members independently as their use
cases might differ. Right now the set of tests is defined as a <code>t_functional</code>
suite maintained by the CentOS Core SIG but this suite is not enough for the
complex scenarios.</p>

<p>The Integration SIG is looking at improving the situation. Two projects were
present and interested in this work: RDO (RPM-based distribution of OpenStack)
and RHEL Identity Management. Both teams have to deal with coordinated package
deliveries across multiple components and both need to get multi-host
deployments tested. RDO can be treated as a product built on top of CentOS
Stream where its own RDO deliveries are installed on top of CentOS Stream
images. RHEL Identity Management (IdM), on the other hand, is a part of RHEL.
It is famously known as a ‘canary in the RHEL mine’ (thanks to Stephen
Gallagher’s being poetic a decade ago): if anything is broken in RHEL, chances
are it will be visible in RHEL IdM testing. With RHEL IdM integration scope
expanding to provide passwordless desktop login support, this becomes even more
important and also requires multi-host testing.</p>

<p>CentOS Integration SIG’s proposal to address these requirements is interesting.
Since CentOS Stream compose event is independent of the tests, a proposal by
Aleksandra Fedorova and Adam Samalik is to treat the compose event in a way
similar to a normal development workflow. Producing CentOS Stream compose would
generate a merge request of a metadata associated with it to a particular git
repository. This merge request then can be reacted to by the various bots and
individuals. Since CentOS Stream compose is public, it is already accessible to
third-party developers to run their tests and report back the results. This way
qualification of the compose promotion to CentOS Stream mirrors can be affected
by all parties and will help to keep already published composes in a
non-conflicting state.</p>

<p>Since most of the projects involved already have their own continuous
integration systems, adding another trigger for those would be trivial. For
RHEL IdM and its upstream components (FreeIPA, SSSD, 389-ds, Dogtag PKI, etc.)
it would also be possible finally to react to changes to CentOS Stream well
ahead of time too. In the past this was complicated by a relative turbulence in
the CentOS Stream composes early in RHEL next minor release development time
when everybody updates their code and stabilization needs a lot of
coordination. I am looking forward to Aleksandra’s proposal to land in the
Integration SIG’s materials soon.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Aleksandra has published her proposal at the <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/centos-connect-follow-up-proposal-for-the-git-interface-to-the-compose-gate/104981">Fedora Discussion board</a></p>

<h2 id="centos-stream-and-epel">CentOS Stream and EPEL</h2>

<p>Two talks, by Troy Dawson and Carl George, described the current state of EPEL
repository and its future interactions with CentOS 10 Stream. Troy’s discussion
was fun, as usual: a lot of statistics obtained from the DNF repository
trackers shows that old habits are hard to get rid off and moving forward is a
struggle to many users despite security and supportability challenges with
older software. Both CentOS 7 and CentOS 8 Stream end of life dates are coming
in 2024, adding enough pressure themselves to that.</p>

<p>There are interesting statistics from the EPEL evolution. In August 2023 at
Flock to Fedora conference Troy and Carl pointed out that 727 packagers
maintained 7298 packages in EPEL 7, 489 packagers handled 4968 packages in EPEL
8, and 396 packagers were handling 5985 packages in EPEL 9. Half a year later
we have 7874 packages in EPEL 7, 5108 packages in EPEL 8, and 6868 packages in
EPEL 9. Pace seems to pick up EPEL 9 with upcoming end of life dates for older
versions. Since soon only EPEL 9 and EPEL 10 would be actively built, there are
probably more packagers that would be active in them as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://vda.li/en/img/resized/2024-centos-connect/epel-packages-800-2bb1c63e5.jpg" /></p>

<p>EPEL 10 is coming soon. It will bring a slight difference in package suffixes
and overall reduction of complexity to packagers. It is great to see how close
EPEL work tracks to ELN activities in Fedora. One thing worth noting is that
every Fedora package maintainer is a potential EPEL maintainer as well because
EPEL reuses Fedora infrastructure for package maintenance. Even if someone is
not maintaining EPEL branches on their Fedora packages (I am not doing that
myself – my packages are mostly in RHEL), it allows easy jump-in and
collaboration. After all, if packages aren’t in RHEL but are in Fedora, their
EPEL presence is just one git branch (and Fedora infrastructure ticket) away.</p>

<h2 id="20-years-of-centos-project">20 years of CentOS project</h2>

<p>First day of the CentOS Connect event ended with a party to celebrate 20 years
of the CentOS Project. First release (“CentOS version 2”) went out on May 14th,
2004 but since CentOS Connect is the closest big event organized by the project
this year, getting a lot of contributors together to celebrate this anniversary
seemed appropriate. A huge cake was presented, so big that it wasn’t possible
to consume it completely during the party. It was delicious (like a lot of
Belgian chocolate!) and next day coffee breaks allowed me to enjoy it a lot.</p>

<h2 id="freeipa-and-centos-project-infrastructure">FreeIPA and CentOS project infrastructure</h2>

<p><a href="https://talks.vda.li/talks/2024/CentOS-Connect-Discuss-Your-FreeIPA.pdf">My own talk</a> was originally planned to gather feedback from all projects which
build on top of CentOS as they use a very similar infrastructure. CentOS
Project infrastructure is shared with Fedora Project which is built around
FreeIPA as a backend and Noggin as a user management frontend. I asked in
advance for some feedback from Fedora, CentOS, AlmaLinux, and RockyLinux
infrastructure teams and haven’t gotten that much which prompted my own
investigation. It is not an easy job since most organizations aren’t really
interested in telling the world details of their core infrastructure. Hope was
that I’d be able to see real world usage and maybe take some lessons from it
back to the development teams.</p>

<p>While working on my talk, we also experienced an outage in Fedora
infrastructure related to the upgrade of the FreeIPA setup used there. My team
has been helping Fedora infrastructure administrators so I finally got the
feedback I was looking for. That led to several fixes upstream and they have
recently been backported to RHEL and CentOS Stream as well. However, the
overall lack of feedback is concerning – or at least I thought so.</p>

<p>During CentOS Connect I had the opportunity to discuss this with both AlmaLinux
(Jonathan) and RockyLinux (Luis) projects’ sysadmins. “It just works” is a common
response I get. Well, that’s nice to hear but what was more exciting to hear is
that these projects went a bit further than we did in Fedora and CentOS Stream
with their environments. Luis <a href="https://talks.vda.li/talks/2024/CentOS-Connect-Discuss-Your-FreeIPA.pdf">has published the whole RockyLinux infrastructure</a>
code responsible for FreeIPA deployment. It is based heavily on
ansible-freeipa, reuses the same components we developed for Fedora
Infrastructure. Rocky also runs FreeIPA tests in OpenQA instance, similarly to
Fedora, and hopefully Luis would contribute more tests to cover passwordless
login, already available in CentOS Stream. This would be a very welcome
contribution in the light of the Integration SIG activities, helping us to test
more complex scenarios community-wide. AlmaLinux infrastructure also uses
ansible-freeipa but the code is not publicly available, for whatever reason.
Jonathan promised to rectify this problem.</p>

<h2 id="hallway-tracks">Hallway tracks</h2>

<p>I had a number of discussions with people from all kinds of CentOS communities.
FreeIPA sits at a unique position by providing secure infrastructure to run
POSIX workloads and linking it with modern requirements to web authentication.
Our effort to improve passwordless login to Linux environments with reuse of
Kerberos to propagate authorization state across multiple machines helps to
solve the ‘between the worlds’ problems. That is something that many academic
institutions have noticed already and many talks I had in the hallways were
related to it.</p></div>
